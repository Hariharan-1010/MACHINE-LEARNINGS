All my knowledge on Machine Learning and AI


Wanted to document my learnings to look back in the future and to anyone has doubt in the topic may find it useful.


## All my stuff related to ML, I will try to post it in this repo.

## MY JOURNEY:

### Completed a course related to machine learning in udemy
